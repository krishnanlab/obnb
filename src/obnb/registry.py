    Args:
        scope: The scope of this object (i.e., the key for this value in the
            ``REGISTRIES`` dictionary).
        name: Name of the object. By default, this is set to a special key,
            "_name_", which will automatically replaced by the name of the
            object at runtime.
        obj: Object to be registered.

    Note:
        Can be used as decorator or a function. See examples below.

    Examples:
        Use as function:

        >>> register(scope="func", name="custom_func", custom_func)

        Use as decorator:

        >>> @register(scope="func", name="custom_func")
        >>> def custom_func():
        >>>     ...

        If ``name`` is set to special key, e.g., "_name_", then it will be
        automatically converted into the name of the object, which is
        "custom_func" in this case (same as above).

        >>> @register(scope="func", name="_name_")
